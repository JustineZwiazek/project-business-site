# Business Site
This week’s project is to create a business one pager website that should contain an image or video header, a signup form, and an accordion. The focus is for you to practice what you've learned about image backgrounds, HTML forms, and how to modify the DOM with JavaScript. You can come up with your own fantasy company or use an existing one.

Requirements:
  •	Style your page
	•	Site should have a header with responsive image/video
	•	Site should have a signup form with at least three different input types
	•	Site should have an FAQ accordion, built with JavaScript

## The problem

I tackled the parts of the assignment I was familiar with first. Started with a design, proceeded to build HTML and styling. I then spent some time learning to build a form. I created the accordion as a last step as I had no previous knowledge of JavaScript.
